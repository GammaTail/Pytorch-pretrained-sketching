This repository implements an Image to Sketch Converter using a U-Net architecture. The model takes an image as input and generates a sketch-like representation as output. The U-Net structure consists of a series of convolutional and transposed convolutional layers with skip connections. The goal of this project is to convert an image into a sketch using a deep learning approach. The U-Net architecture, commonly used for image-to-image tasks, is employed to capture both low-level and high-level features while ensuring spatial details are preserved through skip connections.
Also pre-model has been employed to better grasp on the idea of using pretrained models for this as its a tedious and time consuming work for self train the model. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Srf-WYUixK0wiUddc9y3pNKHHno5PN6R This is the drive link from where I took the weights for the model.
